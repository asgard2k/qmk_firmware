[from Tai] This is a copy of the zeta keyboard folder from the SouthPawEngineer/qmk_firmware_spe fork.
I put this here b/c github does not allow me to have both a fork of the qmk_firware and a fork of SouthPawEngineer/qmk_firmware_spe within the same account.

To build the zeta firmware:
1) Merge any changes you did in this zeta folder to your clone of the SouthPawEngineer/qmk_firmware_spe
2) Build the firmware from the SouthPawEngineer/qmk_firmware_spe
